The position property in [[CSS]] can be used to control positions of elements. See also: [[float]]

### `static`
The default

### `relative`
Offset by some amount from its location within the parent. Can add properties to reposition:
- `top`
- `left`
- `right`
- `bottom`

You can often reproduce this using margins too, so it's not that common.

### `absolute`
Offset by some amount from the borders of its parent. Can use same properties as above to reposition.

### `fixed`
Fixed in-place, even when scrolling?
