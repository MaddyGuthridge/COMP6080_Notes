Powerful tool for having things automagically resize and regroup.

Use properties
```css
.container {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row-reverse;
	justify-content: flex-end;
}
```

### `flex-direction`

Order to put elements

### `justify-content`

How to space things out:

- `flex-start` - align left
- `flex-end` - align right
- `center` - align center
- `space-between` - equal space between elements
- `space-around` - equal space around elements
- `space-evently` - make everything equally spaced, accounting for content size
