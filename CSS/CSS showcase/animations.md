You can use key-frames to animate CSS features.

```css
.animated {
	background: repeating-linear-gradient(
	  90deg,
	  blue 0px,
	  blue 10px,
	  purple 10px,
	  purple 20px
	);
	animation: slider  /* name of keyframe to use */
             1s  /* duration of the animation */
             linear  /* timing function of the animation, eg cubic-bezier */
             0s  /* delay before animation starts */
             infinite  /* how many times the animation should play */
             normal  /* direction of animation, eg "reverse" or "alternate" */
             forwards  /* state to use when animation is paused */
             running;  /* whether the animation is running or paused */
}

/* defines the keyframe named "slider" */
@keyframes slider {
	/* 0% of the way through the animation, we should shift the background */
	0% { background-position: -28px -28px; }
	/* 100% of the way through the animation, we should have the background 
	 * normal */
	100% { background-position: 0px 0px; }
}
```
