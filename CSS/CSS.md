Cascading style sheets. Used to apply [[properties]] to an HTML document

## Cascade
Each element is applied in order. See also: [[inclusion]]
1. External CSS files
2. [[style]] tags in [[HTML]]
3. Inline styles override everything
4. Except for `!important` markers
	- You should probably avoid them though, because they are hacky and make code very unclean

Also consider [[specificity]]
