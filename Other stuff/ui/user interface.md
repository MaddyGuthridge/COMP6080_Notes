User interfaces (UIs) are the interfaces that people use to interact with software.

## UI vs UX
- UI focuses on how the app looks (fonts, layout, and other pretty-pretty things)
- UX focuses on similar things, but from the perspective of how it affects the way that the user interacts with the app (eg can they navigate it easily, are their tasks for the app straightforward).

## Aim of UI
- Make the app simple, and [[less scary]] to new users
- Making it easy to find things: [[visual hierarchy]]
- Making it easier for users to accomplish tasks: [[affordances]]
