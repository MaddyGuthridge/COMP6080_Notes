Affordances are visual properties of something that show what it is (eg a handle on a door shows you can open it).

## Types of affordances

- **Explicit**: telling the user what to do (eg "slide to unlock" from back when Apple was good)
- **Pattern**: using a commonly-used thing to signify what will happen.

- **False**: things that look like they are interactive that actually aren't
