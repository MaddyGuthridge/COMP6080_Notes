Affordances are visual properties of a [[user interface|UI]] element that show what it is (eg a button with "Click me" text on it).

## Types of affordances

- **Explicit**: telling the user what to do (eg "slide to unlock" from back when Apple was good)
- **Pattern**: using a commonly-used thing to signify what will happen.

- **False**: things that look like they are interactive that actually aren't
