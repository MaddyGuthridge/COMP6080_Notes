- Alignment
	- Makes things look trustworthy
	- Even when things aren't aligned, they're still secretly aligned, perhaps by using multiple rows of a grid
	- 12 columns is a good number of columns since it can be subdivided nicely
- Fonts - consistency
	- Choose one or two fonts. Usually one for headers and one for text
- Colours - consistency, but also ways to make things distinct
