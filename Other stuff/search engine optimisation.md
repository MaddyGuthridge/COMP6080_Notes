Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the process of making a page optimised so that search engines can crawl it easily, helping to ensure your page comes up first in search results.

## What to do
- Make sure key content is included on the page before any JS code has run.
- Include relevant [[meta]] tags in the [[head]] of your [[HTML]]

## Why
- If we get more clicks from search engines, we get more money
- You want more money right?
