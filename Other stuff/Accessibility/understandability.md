For a webpage needs to be understandable, it needs to be created in a way so that it can be understood by anyone.

## Defining the language

```html
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```
Very helpful for screen readers

## Keeping things consistent
Don't change the underlying [[HTML]] unless the content is changing. Don't change IDs of elements.

## Making it work with partial downloads
The page should at least look somewhat readable without CSS
