In order to be [[accessibility|accessible]], content should be robust, meaning it can be interpreted by many different kinds of browsers.

## Make it parseable
- Don't forget to close your tags and stuff
- Add a doctype (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) just in case
- No duplicate IDs
- No invalid ID references
- Only add relevant tag attributes

## Use the correct elements
- Don't link stuff up using a `div`, use a `button` instead
