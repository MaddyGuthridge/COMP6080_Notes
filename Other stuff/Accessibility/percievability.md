Making sure people can tell what's there, even if they can't see the page.

## Alt text
Text that can be used as a replacement for images, used by screen readers.

Good alt text
- Describes the image
- Is adapted to the context (eg tie it into the article)
	- For interactive elements, describe what they do, rather than what they are (eg "save button", rather than "floppy disk")
- Is an empty string for decorative images

## Distinguishability
- Make text legible
- Don't use images of text
- Don't resist browser controls (eg zooming)
	- Pages should be able to zoom to 200% without a loss of content or functionality
- Use contrasting colours
	- `4.5:1` for text smaller than 18pt
	- `3:1` for text at 18pt or larger
