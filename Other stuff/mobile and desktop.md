It's important to have our apps work well on both the desktop and on mobile. There are two main strategies for implementing this.

## Two websites

Think `https://example.com` and `https://m.example.com`.

Means you can get a proper tailored design, but you need to maintain two code-bases.

## Responsive websites

Website adapts between desktop and mobile.

Use [[media queries]] to make pages render differently depending on context.
