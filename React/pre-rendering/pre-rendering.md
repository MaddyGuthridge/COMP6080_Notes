[[single-page app|Single-page apps]] are terrible for [[search engine optimisation]], since web crawlers can't see all the content. To fix this, we can pre-render our pages to only contain the bare minimum HTML to display the page.

## Kinds of pre-rendering
- [[Static site generation]]
- [[Server-side rendering]]

## Frameworks for pre-rendering
