Server-side rendering (SSR) is a system for [[pre-rendering]] content on the fly. The server renders the HTML before sending it back to the client.

This is slower than [[static site generation|SSG]] since each page needs to be re-rendered for every user, but still gives the [[search engine optimisation|SEO]] benefits which client-side rendering does not.
