As with all other frameworks, in [[React]], it's important to create a clearly-defined state for your app or things will become impossible to maintain. As it gets more complex.

## Component state
Used to maintain the state of an individual [[component]] (eg the contents of a post). The [[useState]] [[hook]] is good for this.

## Global state
Used to maintain the state of the overall app (eg the user's token). The [[useContext]] [[hook]] is good for this, and there are other tools such as [[Redux]] that are also helpful, if you want to do some more learning.
