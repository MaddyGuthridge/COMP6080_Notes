In [[React]], a hook is a function that is used to let us "hook in" to React's features, such as life-cycle and state.

## Built-in hooks
- [[useState]] to create stateful content in components
- [[useEffect]] to trigger changes in components whenever an event happens
- [[useContext]] to create a global context that is shared across the app

## Other hooks
Many [[component library|component libraries]] provide additional hooks that can be used. Refer to the documentation for your library of choice.
