Declarative UI aims to describe what a UI looks like, rather than how to create it.

## Problems to solve
Declarative UIs aim to solve the following problems
### Increasing complexity
By specifying the end result, we don't need to worry about handling the edge cases - React will sort it out for us.
### Untracked UI Mutations
By writing declaratively, we can ensure that we don't accidentally forget to add/remove elements during transitions.
