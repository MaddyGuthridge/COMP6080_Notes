[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a [[JavaScript]] library to keep track of a global [[state management]]. It's almost definitely much better than [[local storage]]

Redux is built using a [[store]], which then has [[action|actions]] and [[reducer|reducers]] to modify it.

## Benefits
### Debuggable
Redux can track all state changes, allowing you to "time travel" and see what your app did to get itself into an invalid state.
