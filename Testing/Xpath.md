Xpath is a syntax that allows us to search for elements within an XML document using a series of selectors. It is used in [[UI test|UI tests]] to locate difficult-to-find elements using a concise syntax.

```xpath
//form[@id='loginForm']/input[1]
```

- Find a form element, 
- Where the element ID is 'loginForm'
- Then find the first input element within that form.
